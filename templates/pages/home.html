<p class='lead'>GroupBot puts all of the minutiae for each group in one place.  Whether it's a study group, a living group,
or anything in between, GroupBot can make management simpler.</p>
<p>When you make a <strong>Group</strong>, you can add <strong>Members</strong>.  Those Members can have <strong>Roles</strong>
(like President, Secretary, or Brother).</p>
<p>Roles simplify running your group by putting all of the related information in one place that stays the same when the
person performing the Role changes.  After the next President is elected, they step into the Role and use or build on the
documentation created by the Member before them.</p>
<p>Members can create and assign each other <strong>Tasks</strong>.  They can also create <strong>Events</strong>, as well
 as invite people, RSVP, and take attendance.</p>
