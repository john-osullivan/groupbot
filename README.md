# Welcome
This is Groupify, a cloud-based group management platform.  In a sentence, it lets people make *groups* which have *members* who perform *roles* which have and distributed *responsibilities*.  Those responsibilities can optionally be worth points.  Groups can also connect to other groups in a hierarchy (i.e. a fraternity is a child of its national organization) or in partnership (i.e. a fraternity works with its school's IntraFraternity Council).  Documentation will be updated as the project continues!
